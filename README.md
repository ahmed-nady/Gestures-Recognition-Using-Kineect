# Gestures-Recognition-Using-Kineect
Using Kinect for Controlling The 3D Model in ImageJ through the Gestures



This project is based on Candescent NUI Library located at candescentnui.codeplex.com or https://github.com/VentaApps/Candescent-NUI-20148-for-Kinect-V2
- we used the Image Manipulation Sample(project) to build our project that enables us to control the 3D Model in ImageJ instead of just images. In addition, The Last gesture can be repeated  number of times based on the detected number of fingertips
